This is an brief introduction for my first OTP mini project, which is to build a Google homepage using only HTML and CSS!
I was able to ultilize CSS flex and grid to put my elements in order, and use media queries to make them responsive to viewport change. The new thing I've learned from this project is how to put icon in your input form. On top of that, I kind of enjoy the process of solving problems using different onlone sources. The sense of achievement I got whenever I figured out how to solve the problem is a huge confidence boost! I'm quite satisfied with the result but I'm sure there is still room for improvement! (For example I still couldn't figure out how to decrease the margin between navbar and logo as well as the one between language choices and the footer in accordance to viewport change from the top and the bottom)
But again I'm happy with what I have achieved! I will definitely come back to this project again to perfect it!
